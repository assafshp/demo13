# Overview

This product is a simple web-based calculator application. It aims to provide basic arithmetic operations to general users who need a quick and accessible tool for calculations without needing a physical calculator or a desktop application. Its value lies in its ease of use, accessibility across devices, and intuitive interface.

# Core Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - *What it does*: Takes two numbers and an operator, and displays the result.
  - *Why it's important*: These are the fundamental operations for any calculator.
  - *How it works at a high level*: User inputs numbers via a virtual keypad or physical keyboard, selects an operation, and sees the result.
- **Clear Functionality**: A clear button to reset the input and output.
  - *What it does*: Clears the current input and the displayed result.
  - *Why it's important*: Allows users to quickly start a new calculation.
  - *How it works at a high level*: Resets the calculator state to its initial blank state.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
  - *What it does*: Prevents crashes and informs the user of invalid input/operations.
  - *Why it's important*: Ensures a robust and user-friendly experience.
  - *How it works at a high level*: Checks for invalid operations before computation and displays a user-friendly error.

# User Experience

- **User Personas**: Anyone needing quick calculations: students, office workers, general users.
- **Key User Flows**: 
  1.  Open web app.
  2.  Input first number.
  3.  Select operator.
  4.  Input second number.
  5.  View result.
  6.  Clear for new calculation.
- **UI/UX Considerations**: 
  -   Clean, minimalist design.
  -   Large, easy-to-press buttons for numbers and operators.
  -   Responsive layout for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  -   Clear display area for input and results.

# Technical Architecture

- **System Components**: A single-page application (SPA) running entirely in the browser.
  -   **Frontend**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for logic.
- **Data Models**: No complex data models. Numbers and operation history can be stored in transient JavaScript variables.
- **APIs and Integrations**: No external APIs or integrations required for basic functionality.
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: Standard web hosting for static files (HTML, CSS, JS). No server-side processing needed for core features.

# Development Roadmap

- **MVP requirements**:
  -   Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
  -   Clear button.
  -   Basic UI with responsive design.
  -   Error handling for division by zero.
- **Future enhancements**:
  -   Scientific functions (square root, power, trigonometry).
  -   Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).
  -   Calculation history display.
  -   Keyboard input support.
  -   Dark mode toggle.

# Logical Dependency Chain

- **Phase 1: Core UI and Basic Input/Output**
  -   Set up HTML structure for calculator display and buttons.
  -   Implement CSS for basic styling and responsive layout.
  -   Connect button clicks to display input on screen.
- **Phase 2: Basic Arithmetic Logic**
  -   Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  -   Integrate logic to perform calculations when equals button is pressed.
  -   Add clear functionality.
- **Phase 3: Error Handling and Edge Cases**
  -   Implement division by zero error handling.
  -   Handle multiple decimal points or invalid number inputs.
- **Phase 4: Enhancements (Iterative)**
  -   Add scientific functions incrementally.
  -   Implement memory functions.
  -   Develop calculation history.

# Risks and Mitigations

- **Technical challenges**: 
  -   Floating-point arithmetic precision issues in JavaScript.
    -   *Mitigation*: Use libraries or custom functions to handle precision, if necessary, or clearly state limitations.
  -   Ensuring responsive design across all target devices.
    -   *Mitigation*: Utilize modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, media queries) and thorough testing on various emulators/devices.
- **Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon**: 
  -   Scope creep leading to delayed initial release.
    -   *Mitigation*: Strictly adhere to the defined MVP features, deferring all enhancements to future phases.
- **Resource constraints**: 
  -   Limited time for development.
    -   *Mitigation*: Prioritize core features, leverage existing CSS frameworks or UI libraries to speed up design.
